Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game played by two or more people. One player thinks a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other players must try to guess. They do this by saying the letters or numbers that they think are in the name. The name is displayed as a dash line. When a guessing player gives a letter or number in a word, the other player writes the letter or number in the places where they are in the name. If the letter or number is not in the name, the other player draws part of the image of the hanging man as a mathematical symbol (the type of number used for counting).
The game ends when:
•	The guessing player completes the word, or correctly guesses the whole word.
•	The other player completes the diagram of the hanged man.

In this python program the guessing player is the user and the player who complete the diagram is the python program.
